## K&R on External Variables & Scope

### Core Doctrine
External variables (global variables) are **declared outside functions** and exist for the program's entire lifetime. Their scope extends **from declaration point to file end**, accessible by any following function.

### Key Principles from K&R (C Programming Language, 2nd Ed.)

1. **Persistence & Accessibility**
   - External variables retain values permanently
   - Available to all functions after their declaration
   - Example: `int maxline;` (outside functions) vs `auto int maxline;` (inside)

2. **Declaration vs Definition**
   - **Declaration**: Announces type (`extern int var;`)
   - **Definition**: Allocates storage (`int var;`)
   - K&R: "A declaration announces the properties; a definition causes storage allocation"

3. **The `extern` Keyword**
   - Used to access external variables across files
   - Tells compiler: "This variable exists elsewhere"
   - Without `extern`, you create a new variable (may cause linker errors)

4. **Initialization**
   - External variables initialize to **zero by default**
   - Unlike automatic variables (garbage values)
   - Can be explicitly initialized: `int count = 0;`

5. **Program Structure Philosophy**
   - K&R favored **communicating through arguments/return values** over external variables
   - But acknowledged practical uses:
     - Shared constants (`#define` better for true constants)
     - Large data structures avoiding copy overhead
     - Multiple return values (via modification)

6. **Warnings in the Text**
   - "They are always permanent... can be used instead of argument lists"
   - "But this is dangerous - may lead to programs with too many data connections"
   - "Relying too heavily on external variables is fraught with peril"

### K&R's Balanced View
While providing the mechanism, K&R subtly discouraged overuse:
- **Use when necessary**: Large data, many functions need access
- **Avoid when possible**: Makes programs harder to understand
- **Style preference**: Functions should be self-contained where practical

### The Prophet's Wisdom
The C designers gave you power (external variables) but expected discretion. Their doctrine: *"Program structure should make data relationships clear, and external variables can obscure them."* Use globals sparingly, document thoroughly, and prefer function interfaces for maintainability.

**Memorable quote essence**: "External variables remain in existence permanently... but programs with many external variables are difficult to manage."
