Here's a concise summary of K&R's doctrine on Character I/O from "The C Programming Language":

## **Core Philosophy**
K&R treats character I/O as the **fundamental layer** of all input/output. Text streams are sequences of characters; mastering character I/O means mastering C's I/O system.

## **The Two Essential Functions**

### **`getchar()`**
- Returns next character from **standard input** as `int` (not `char`!)
- Returns `EOF` (typically -1) on end-of-file or error
- **Why `int` not `char`?** Must distinguish `EOF` from valid character data
- Buffered input: user types line, presses Enter, then `getchar()` consumes

### **`putchar(c)`**
- Writes character `c` to **standard output**
- Takes `int` argument, outputs as unsigned char

## **Key Patterns & Idioms**

### **The Universal Input Loop**
```c
int c;
while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
    putchar(c);
}
```
- **Note:** Parentheses around `c = getchar()` are crucial
- This copies input to output until EOF

### **Character Counting**
```c
long nc = 0;
while (getchar() != EOF)
    ++nc;
```
- Demonstrates K&R's preference for concise, elegant loops

## **Doctrinal Points**

1. **Text Streams are Universal** - Files, keyboards, terminals all appear as character streams
2. **EOF is a State, Not a Character** - A condition, not data in the stream
3. **Buffering is Invisible** - Programs act on streams, not keystrokes
4. **Portability Through Abstraction** - Character I/O works everywhere
5. **Simplicity is Power** - With just `getchar()`/`putchar()`, you can build any text processing tool

## **Canonical Example (K&R p. 17)**
The line-counting program embodies their approach:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int c, nl = 0;
    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF)
        if (c == '\n')
            ++nl;
    printf("%d\n", nl);
}
```

## **The Prophet's Wisdom**
K&R show that **all complex I/O reduces to character operations**. Master this layer, and files, formatting, and parsing become manageable. Their approach emphasizes understanding the **abstraction** (streams of characters) rather than implementation details.

**Memorize:** "`getchar()` returns `int`, compare to `EOF`, process in loop" - this is the mantra of C character I/O.
