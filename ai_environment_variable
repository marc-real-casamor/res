There are several ways to assign the output of `cat` to an environment variable in Unix/Linux shells:

## 1. **Using Command Substitution (Most Common)**

### With backticks:
```bash
variable=`cat filename.txt`
```

### With `$()` (preferred - more readable and nestable):
```bash
variable=$(cat filename.txt)
```

## 2. **Examples**

```bash
# Read entire file into variable
content=$(cat file.txt)

# Read specific file
config=$(cat /etc/config.conf)

# Use with other commands
lines=$(cat file.txt | wc -l)
```

## 3. **Alternative Without `cat`**

You can also use shell redirection:

```bash
# Using < operator
variable=$(< file.txt)

# This is often faster than cat as it's a shell built-in
```

## 4. **Practical Examples**

```bash
# Store file content
file_content=$(cat document.txt)

# Use the variable
echo "$file_content"

# Count words in variable
word_count=$(echo "$file_content" | wc -w)

# Process line by line
while IFS= read -r line; do
    echo "Processing: $line"
done <<< "$file_content"
```

## 5. **Important Considerations**

- **Quoting**: Always use double quotes when echoing variables to preserve formatting:
  ```bash
  echo "$variable"  # Preserves line breaks and spaces
  ```

- **Large files**: For very large files, consider processing line-by-line instead of loading entire file into memory:
  ```bash
  while IFS= read -r line; do
      # process each line
  done < file.txt
  ```

- **Command output**: You can also capture command output:
  ```bash
  process_output=$(some_command)
  ```

## 6. **Verification**

Check that the variable contains the content:
```bash
# View first few lines
echo "${variable}" | head -5

# Check length
echo "${#variable}"  # Character count
echo "$variable" | wc -l  # Line count
```

The `$(cat filename)` approach is the most portable and works in all POSIX-compliant shells (bash, sh, zsh, ksh, etc.).
