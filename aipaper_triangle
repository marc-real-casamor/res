Looking at your code, I can see you're trying to create a triangle pattern, but there are a few issues. The main problem is that `b` is initialized to `-1` outside the loops and never gets reset, so it only works for the first row.

Here's how to fix it to draw a triangle where `A` represents both the base and height:

```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int a = 0;
    int b;
    
    while (a <= 5) 
    {
        b = 0;  // Reset b for each new row
        while(b < a)
        {
            printf("#");
            b++;
        }
        printf("\n");
        a++;
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
#
##
###
####
#####
```

However, if you want `A` to be both the base AND height (meaning the triangle should be symmetrical), you might want an isosceles triangle. Here's a version that creates a symmetrical triangle:

```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int height = 5;  // A represents both base and height
    int row, spaces, stars;
    
    for (row = 1; row <= height; row++)
    {
        // Print leading spaces
        for (spaces = 0; spaces < height - row; spaces++)
        {
            printf(" ");
        }
        
        // Print stars
        for (stars = 0; stars < (2 * row - 1); stars++)
        {
            printf("#");
        }
        
        printf("\n");
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
    #
   ###
  #####
 #######
#########
```

**Or if you want to use your original variable names and structure:**

```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int a = 1;  // Start from 1
    int b;
    int spaces;
    
    while (a <= 5) 
    {
        // Print spaces first
        spaces = 0;
        while (spaces < 5 - a)
        {
            printf(" ");
            spaces++;
        }
        
        // Print # characters
        b = 0;
        while(b < (2 * a - 1))
        {
            printf("#");
            b++;
        }
        
        printf("\n");
        a++;
    }
}
```

The key fixes to your original code were:
1. Move `b = 0` inside the outer loop to reset it for each row
2. Start `a` from 1 instead of 0 to get proper triangle shape
3. For a symmetrical triangle, you need to print spaces before the # characters

Choose the version that matches what kind of triangle you want to draw!
